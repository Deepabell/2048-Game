# 2048-Game
It’s a sliding puzzle game on a grid (usually 4×4) where:  You move tiles (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys.  When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile (sum of both).  After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty spot.  The goal: Reach the tile “2048”.
